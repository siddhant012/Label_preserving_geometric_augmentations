# Label_preserving_geometric_augmentations
Apply geometric transformations using projective and affine transformation matrices to images and also modify the image label accordingly. When using geometric augmentation to increase our dataset-size, image labels like bounding boxes also need to be modified. This python script serves exactly this purpose. Supports a variety of labels like bounding boxes, in-image feature points etc.
